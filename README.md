# FiveM Polls

This script allows you to set up simple polls for your players to vote on. It is configurable to do any number of options.

**This script doesn't do anything by itself. You will need to code the actual options yourself. See `example/aopvote.lua` for an example.**

## Installing

- [pNotify](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-pnotify-in-game-js-notifications-using-noty/20659) is required for the actual vote messages.
- Copy this resource to your resources folder.
- Add additional scripts to set up your votes.
